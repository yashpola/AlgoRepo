# AlgoRepo

Updated as at: <u>04/02/2025</u>

This repository is a collection of the data structures and algorithms (DSA) I implemented to both enhance theoretical learning as well as log some coding practice. The primary language of this repository will be Python (and sometimes Java).

An index of the DSA I've explored till the updated date will be maintained in this README.

### Data Structures

Simple Graphs (Trivial 2D Adjacency Matrix representation)

### Algorithms

##### Flow

Maximum Network Flow

##### Search

Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Depth-First Search (DFS)

##### Matching

Maximum Bipartite Matching

#### Convex Hull
