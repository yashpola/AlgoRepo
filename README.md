Updated as at: <u>29/10/2024</u>

This repository is a collection of the data structures and algorithms (DSA) I implemented to both enhance theoretical learning as well as log some coding practice. The primary languages of this repository will be (in-order) Python, Java, and C++.

An index of the DSA I've explored till the updated date will be maintained in this README.

### Data Structures

Directed & Undirected Simple Graphs (Trivial 2D Adjacency Matrix representation)

### Algorithms

##### Search

Breadth-First (Graph) Search (BFS)
Depth-First (Graph) Search (DFS)

##### Flow

Maximum Network Flow
